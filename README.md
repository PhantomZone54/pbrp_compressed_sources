Sometimes it is hard to get the _repo files_ to build _PBRP_
:worried:

That's why I used _Regalstreak_'s Project *Skadoosh* by slightly modifying as my [_tranSkadooSH_](https://github.com/rokibhasansagar/tranSkadooSH). :smirk:

### Totally Remade :hammer:
As the __.repo__ folder is convenient to download, but the unpacked files are easy to use.
Thats why I reused my other repository's [source](https://github.com/PhantomZone54/twrp_sources_norepo/) within this to make Distribution of PitchBlack-Recovery Source Code, but only for Android 6.0 devices.
